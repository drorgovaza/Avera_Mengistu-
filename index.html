            <p class="p_text">Avraham "Avera" Mengistu (born August 22, 1986) is a missing Israeli citizen. Mangisto, who is mentally ill, crossed the perimeter fence into the Gaza Strip, in the Zikim Beach area, on September 7, 2014, and since then his fate has not been known. There are estimates that he is being held by Hamas. [2] As of 2022, he is one of four missing Israelis who entered the Gaza Strip and the only Jew among them.</p>
